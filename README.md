# Snapshot
A utility for enabling snapshot backups on \*nix systems.

# Usage

Once a configuration change has been made you must run the below command (w/ optional config path).

```
snapshot update [config]
```

# Install

Soon this package will be avilable on major linux distribution but for now a PKGBUILD is included in the source for Arch Linux.

Snapshot is written in shell so the only installation step is to copy 'snapshot' to your bin directory.

# Contribution

Snapshot was first written for personal use but has a goal of compatibility and robustness.
If you experiance a compatibility issue or a bug feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub.
